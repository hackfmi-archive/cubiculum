      - Don’t worry. I will do my best.:
        !- trust you will.
      - Same here, buddy.:
        !- Surely it will be quick.
    !- [positive] Given the circumstances, quite well. Thank you.:
      - That’s the spirit.:
        - For now, that is.
      - I am worried myself.:
        - You should be. The end is near.
    !- [neutral] Sorry, I am a little busy worrying about going to die.:
      - I am leaving you alone then.:
        - Try to stop that bomb!
      - Sorry, I need just a minute.:
        - Be quick and go stop that bomb.
    !- [unfriendly] I don’t see the purpose of this talk.:
      - Anyway.:
        !- …
      - I need your help!:
        !- What do you want?
      - Just let me save your life!:
        !- What do you want?
  - I am here to ask about the bomb.:
    !- I don’t know who has it.:
      - Have you seen anything?:
        !- [friendly] Churchill was acting strange.
          - What do you mean?:
            !- He was talking to himself. He was looking tired and not his usual self. He was holding a bottle of whiskey half empty and he was really quiet. Also, when Napoleon asked him to a game of chess, he exited the room without saying anything. That’s strange if you ask me.
        !- [positive] Check Churchill, but you didn’t hear it from me.
        !- [neutral] I know an Englishman, who may be anxious about something.:
          - What do you mean?:
            !- That’s all I can tell you now.
        !- [unfriendly] I know something, but I don’t trust you will act accordingly.
          - You have to trust me.:
            !- Sorry, but I prefer talking to somebody else about that subject.
      - Who do you suspect?
      - You seem suspicious.
      - What do you think of Napoleon?:
        !- He is a jerk. I don’t trust him.
      - What do you think of Gandhi?:
        !- I nice person, but kind of illogical.
      - What do you think of Chaplin?:
        !- You can’t take that person seriously. He is an insult to my mother tongue.
      - What do you think of Churchill?:
        !- Well, he is usually a nice guy. Kind of a ruin, but very smart.
  - Have you heard anything new?:
    !- [friendly] Churchill was acting strange.:
      - What do you mean?:
        !- I think he might know something about the threat.:
          - Do you think he has the bomb?:
            !- Not sure. I am just saying he was not his usual self.
          - Are you sure?:
            !- In times like that there is nothing one can be sure about.
    !- [positive] No, but I know something.:
      - About what?:
        !- About the bomb.
    !- [neutral] What do you mean new?:
    !- [unfriendly] No and I won’t.
